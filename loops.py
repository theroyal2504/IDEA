#The range() function returns a sequence of numbers,
#starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default),
#and stops before a specified number.

#When the user call range() with three arguments,
#the user can choose not only where the series of
#numbers will start and stop
#If the user doesnâ€™t provide a step, then range() will
#automatically behave as if the step is 1. In this example,
#we are printing even numbers between 0 and 10, so we choose
#our starting point from 0(start = 0) and stop the series at
#10(stop = 10). For printing an even number the difference
#between one number and the next must be 2 (step = 2) after
#providing a step we get the following output (0, 2, 4, 8).
#multiparamitter  range(start ,stop, step)
